## Current Status

✅ **PRODUCTION DEPLOYED** - Live and operational in Azure Container Apps

### What's Done

**Core Functionality** (v0.2.0):
- Core analysis engine (header-validator, content-analyzer, risk-scorer)
- Threat intel integration (VirusTotal, AbuseIPDB, URLScan) with parallel execution
- Mailbox monitoring via Microsoft Graph API (60s polling)
- HTML email reply functionality with risk assessment
- HTTP server with health checks (`/health`, `/ready`)
- Production-ready logging and error handling
- Configuration management and graceful shutdown

**Infrastructure**:
- GitHub repository created
- Code quality validated (all functions ≤25 lines)
- TypeScript builds successfully
- GitHub issues created for Phase 2/3 features
- Docker multi-stage build (node:18-alpine, 264MB)
- Azure Container Apps deployment (East US)
- Azure Container Registry (phishingagentacr.azurecr.io)
- Azure AD permissions configured (Mail.Read, Mail.Send, Mail.ReadWrite)
- Production testing validated with real phishing email

**Production Environment**:
- Resource Group: rg-phishing-agent
- Container App: phishing-agent
- Environment: cae-phishing-agent
- Monitored Mailbox: phishing@chelseapiers.com
- Azure AD App ID: 1244194f-9bb7-4992-8306-6d54b17db0e1
- Auto-scaling: 1-3 replicas (0.5 vCPU, 1Gi RAM each)
- Monthly Cost: ~$30-35 (Container Apps + ACR Basic SKU)

**Production Validation** (2025-10-19):
- ✅ Container deployed successfully
- ✅ Health checks passing (/health, /ready)
- ✅ Mailbox monitor polling every 60 seconds
- ✅ Email detection working (60s latency)
- ✅ Analysis performance: <1 second
- ✅ HTML reply sent successfully
- ✅ End-to-end test with real phishing email: PASSED
- ✅ Risk score: 7.65/10 (HIGH severity, 9 threat indicators)

### What's Next

**Monitoring** (Current Focus):
- Monitor production for 1 week
- Collect usage metrics and performance data
- Measure accuracy (true/false positive rates)
- Gather user feedback on analysis quality

**Post-Validation** (Based on Results):
- Decide on CI/CD automation investment
- Consider Phase 2 features (brand impersonation, attachment analysis)
- Evaluate need for advanced features (ML, LLM enhancement)

---

## Architecture

**Orchestration**: Custom async with `Promise.allSettled()` (no framework)
**No LLM**: Pure rule-based phishing detection
**Threat Intel**: Optional VirusTotal, AbuseIPDB, URLScan.io (parallel, 5s timeout)
**Performance**: 3-5s per email (up to 8s with threat intel)

**Pipeline**:
```
Email → Headers → Content → [Threat Intel Parallel] → Risk Score → HTML Reply
```
