#### Issue #2: Mailbox Monitor Service
**Status**: ✅ Completed (2025-10-16)
**Priority**: P0 (Blocker)

Monitor designated mailbox for new emails:
- Graph API integration (app-only auth)
- 60-second polling loop
- Email parsing and extraction
- Error handling and retry logic

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [x] Polls mailbox every 60 seconds
- [x] Handles up to 50 emails per check
- [x] Graceful error recovery
- [x] Health check endpoint

#### Issue #3: Email Reply Functionality
**Status**: ✅ Completed (2025-10-16)
**Priority**: P0 (Blocker)

Send HTML-formatted analysis results:
- HTML email template with risk assessment
- Color-coded severity badges
- Threat indicators list
- Recommended actions

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [x] HTML rendering works in major email clients
- [x] Mobile-responsive design
- [x] Reply sent within 10 seconds of analysis
- [x] Handles delivery failures gracefully

#### Issue #4: Configuration Management
**Status**: ✅ Completed (2025-10-16)
**Priority**: P1 (High)

Simple environment-based configuration:
- Load from .env file
- Validate required variables on startup
- Type-safe configuration access
- Secure secret handling

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [x] All config in .env.example documented
- [x] Fails fast on missing required vars
- [x] No secrets in logs

#### Issue #5: Logging & Monitoring
**Status**: ✅ Completed (2025-10-16)
**Priority**: P1 (High)

Structured logging for observability:
- Winston logger with JSON format
- Log levels (info, warn, error, security)
- Correlation IDs for request tracing
- Health check endpoints

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [x] All critical events logged
- [x] No PII in logs
- [x] Metrics tracked (emails processed, phishing detected)

#### Issue #6: Threat Intel Integration
**Status**: ✅ Completed (2025-10-16) - Implemented in MVP
**Priority**: P0 (Blocker)

Optional external reputation checks:
- VirusTotal URL/domain scanning
- AbuseIPDB IP reputation
- URLScan.io screenshot capture
- Caching to avoid rate limits

**Implementation Note**: Originally planned for Phase 2, but implemented in MVP using custom async orchestration with `Promise.allSettled()` for parallel API calls. See decision log for "Custom Async Orchestration for Threat Intel".

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [x] Works with and without API keys
- [x] Graceful degradation if APIs unavailable
- [x] 5-minute cache TTL
- [x] Parallel execution with timeouts

## Phase 2: Enhanced Detection (Post-MVP)

**Target**: v0.3.0
**Estimated Duration**: 2-3 weeks

### Features

#### Issue #7: Brand Impersonation Detection
**Status**: Not Started
**Priority**: P2 (Medium)

Detect common brand spoofing:
- PayPal, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple
- Bank impersonation (Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo)
- Typosquatting detection (paypa1.com, micros0ft.com)
- Logo/image analysis (optional)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Detects top 20 impersonated brands
- [ ] Identifies typosquatting patterns
- [ ] <100ms analysis time

#### Issue #8: Attachment Analysis
**Status**: Not Started
**Priority**: P2 (Medium)

Basic attachment risk assessment:
- File type validation (exe, scr, bat, vbs → high risk)
- Macro-enabled documents (docm, xlsm → medium risk)
- Suspicious filenames (invoice.pdf.exe)
- File size anomalies

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Detects dangerous file extensions
- [ ] Flags macro-enabled documents
- [ ] Analyzes filename patterns

#### Issue #9: Zod Runtime Validation
**Status**: Not Started
**Priority**: P2 (Medium)

Add Zod for production-grade runtime validation:
- Configuration validation (environment variables)
- External API response validation (Graph API, threat intel APIs)
- Email header/body parsing validation
- Type-safe error handling with detailed error messages

**Rationale**: While TypeScript provides compile-time type safety, Zod adds critical runtime validation for external data sources. This is especially important for:
- Validating untrusted email inputs
- Catching malformed API responses early
- Providing clear error messages for debugging
- Ensuring data integrity throughout the pipeline

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] All environment variables validated with Zod schemas
- [ ] Graph API responses validated before processing
- [ ] Threat intel API responses validated
- [ ] Email parsing with schema validation
- [ ] Comprehensive error messages for validation failures

**Implementation Notes**:
- Add `zod` dependency (~56KB)
- Create schemas in `src/lib/schemas.ts`
- Use `safeParse()` for graceful error handling
- Log validation failures for monitoring

## Phase 3: Advanced Features (Future)

**Target**: v0.4.0+
**Estimated Duration**: TBD

### Potential Features

#### Issue #9: Machine Learning Model
**Status**: Backlog
**Priority**: P3 (Low)

Train custom phishing detection model:
- Supervised learning on labeled dataset
- Feature extraction from headers/content
- Model serving via REST API
- Periodic retraining pipeline

**Considerations**:
- Requires large labeled dataset
- Infrastructure for model training/serving
- May not improve much over rule-based

#### Issue #10: LLM-Enhanced Analysis (Optional)
**Status**: Backlog
**Priority**: P3 (Low)

Optional Claude API integration for edge cases:
- Complex social engineering detection
- Contextual risk assessment
- Natural language explanations
- Only trigger for borderline cases (score 4-6)

**Considerations**:
- Adds latency (5-10s)
- Costs $0.01-0.05 per analysis
- May be overkill for most emails

#### Issue #11: Reporting Dashboard
**Status**: Backlog
**Priority**: P3 (Low)

Web dashboard for analytics:
- Daily/weekly phishing metrics
- Top senders/domains flagged
- False positive rate tracking
- User feedback trends
