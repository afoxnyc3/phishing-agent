## Phase 2: Enhanced Detection (Post-MVP)

**Target**: v0.3.0
**Estimated Duration**: 2-3 weeks

### Features

#### Issue #7: Brand Impersonation Detection
**Status**: ✅ Completed
**Priority**: P2 (Medium)

Detect common brand spoofing:
- PayPal, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple
- Bank impersonation (Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo)
- Typosquatting detection (paypa1.com, micros0ft.com)
- Logo/image analysis (optional - deferred)

**Implementation Status**:
- ✅ Brand impersonation detection (`src/analysis/content-analyzer.ts:357-372`)
- ✅ Typosquatting detection (`src/analysis/content-analyzer.ts:386-402`)
- ✅ **20 brands implemented** based on 2024-2025 phishing research:
  - Tech (5): Microsoft, Apple, Google, Adobe, LinkedIn
  - Financial (5): PayPal, Chase, Mastercard, American Express, Wells Fargo
  - Retail/E-commerce (5): Amazon, Walmart, DHL, FedEx, Netflix
  - Social/Communication (5): Facebook, Meta, Instagram, WhatsApp, IRS
- ✅ 6 typosquatting patterns (character substitution: 0→o, 1→l, 3→e)
- ✅ Integrated into analysis pipeline (`src/agents/phishing-agent.ts:109-124`)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [x] Basic brand detection logic implemented
- [x] Detects top 20 impersonated brands (20/20 complete)
- [x] Identifies typosquatting patterns (6 patterns)
- [x] <100ms analysis time (validated with performance tests)

#### Issue #8: Attachment Analysis
**Status**: Not Started
**Priority**: P2 (Medium)

Basic attachment risk assessment:
- File type validation (exe, scr, bat, vbs → high risk)
- Macro-enabled documents (docm, xlsm → medium risk)
- Suspicious filenames (invoice.pdf.exe)
- File size anomalies

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Detects dangerous file extensions
- [ ] Flags macro-enabled documents
- [ ] Analyzes filename patterns

#### Issue #9: Zod Runtime Validation
**Status**: ✅ Completed (2025-10-18)
**Priority**: P2 (Medium)

Add Zod for production-grade runtime validation:
- Configuration validation (environment variables)
- External API response validation (Graph API, threat intel APIs)
- Email header/body parsing validation
- Type-safe error handling with detailed error messages

**Rationale**: While TypeScript provides compile-time type safety, Zod adds critical runtime validation for external data sources. This is especially important for:
- Validating untrusted email inputs
- Catching malformed API responses early
- Providing clear error messages for debugging
- Ensuring data integrity throughout the pipeline

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [x] All environment variables validated with Zod schemas
- [x] Graph API responses validated before processing
- [x] Threat intel API responses validated
- [x] Email parsing with schema validation
- [x] Comprehensive error messages for validation failures
- [x] 35 comprehensive schema tests with 100% coverage

**Implementation**:
- Added `zod` dependency (56KB minified)
- Created comprehensive schemas in `src/lib/schemas.ts`
- Implemented `safeParse()` and `validate()` helpers
- Validated environment config on module load
- Validated Graph API email list and email responses
- Validated VirusTotal and AbuseIPDB API responses
- Maintained 94.62% overall test coverage

#### Issue #12: Cloud Deployment Readiness
**Status**: ✅ Completed
**Priority**: P0 (Blocker)

Prepare MVP for cloud deployment with comprehensive deployment guides:
- Docker multi-stage build (node:18-alpine)
- Container registry setup (Azure, AWS, GCP)
- Container hosting configuration (ACA, ECS, Cloud Run)
- Azure AD permissions configuration
- Deployment documentation and validation procedures

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [x] Docker image builds successfully (linux/amd64 platform)

- [x] Health check endpoints implemented (/health, /ready)
- [x] Environment variable configuration documented
- [x] End-to-end deployment validation procedures
- [x] Performance targets defined and testable
- [x] Deployment documentation created (DEPLOYMENT_PLAN.md, DEPLOY_MANUAL.md)

**Deployment Options**:
- **Azure**: Container Apps, Container Instances
- **AWS**: ECS, Fargate, App Runner
- **GCP**: Cloud Run, GKE
- **Estimated Monthly Cost**: ~$30-50 (varies by provider and region)

**Deployment Approach**: Manual deployment recommended for MVP validation (Lean Startup methodology - validate before automating with CI/CD)
